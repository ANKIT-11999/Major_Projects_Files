"Target Marketing tool"
 
Problem:Target marketing for website or app

Stack used:
-frontend:React.js
-backend:Express.js
-DataBase-MongoDB

The product idea is to target the specific users of any website (eg:e-commerce)and engage them 
with push notification,email & messaging along with segmentation of users according to different user and 
events performed by them.

Progress:
-so far we made the segmentation part where all users can be segmented under two main categories
I-based on user behavourial attributes such as gender,age etc
II-based on events performed by user eg;product purchased within certain limit
-we can see all the users at one place and all segments at one place on clicking segments we can also
check the users inside the segments,and on clicking users we can see their details

Functionality in future:
To send the email,messages and push notification to all the users according to specific segments
Analytics of user and segments
